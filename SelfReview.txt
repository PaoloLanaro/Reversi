Our experience with this assignment was one of quite a lot of frustration. We had to send lots of
emails back and forth, and although our providers were fairly responsive, we just didn't like the
medium being email. We ran into lots of issues with our providers code which meant that we had to
send out a lot of emails, and our providers weren't able to fix all the issues we pointed out, so we
weren't able to get some of the code compiling. We therefore had to comment out these areas of the
code, and you can read more about those issues at the top of the README. The main experience with
our providers was positive, and they modified lots of the issues we found, but they weren't able to
get to all the issues, and the provided code itself was fairly buggy.

We wish we had stored the position of our cells within the cells, to limit the need for the getting
of different neighbors. This would have cleaned up many of our methods and allowed us a lot more
flexibility with our cells implementation and use. We also hadn't realized, but there were a few
places where we cast to a derived class completely redundantly, and have since removed that as our
clients pointed it out. We learnt the lessons of having well documented code with the code provided
to us, as some things were particularly vague and required us to ask the providers how they
implemented their methods / particular derived classes.
