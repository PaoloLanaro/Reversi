Design Critique:
The interfaces provided exhibit some flexibility but could benefit from refinement. Notably, the
ReversiModel interface contains numerous unnecessary methods, causing confusion regarding their
purpose and relevance to the program. The tight coupling of the model with the GenericPlayer poses
challenges in adapting the view. To enhance modularity, it's recommended to decouple GenericPlayer
from the model and consider removing duplicated getters that are in both the ReversiModel and the
ReadOnlyReversiModel to just the ReadOnlyReversiModel interface for improved clarity and cohesion.

Implementation Critique:
The provided view demonstrates partial capability, displaying a hexagonal board efficiently.
However, there are issues such as non-scalability with the window, utilizing mouseDragged instead of
more suitable events, and a noticeable delay in hexagon highlighting. Addressing these concerns
would enhance the overall user experience. Additionally, optimizing the coordinate system
alignment, improving the view implementation, and minimizing unnecessary methods in the codebase
would contribute to code reusability. Additionally, outside the view implementation, there were
callback methods in the model interface, but no controller was provided. I suggest implementing a
working controller to utilize those methods or remove them from the provided code to avoid confusing
future developers on unused methods.

Documentation Critique:
While the codebase includes sufficient JavaDoc, there is room for improvement in terms of spelling
and grammatical errors. Ensuring consistency in documentation style and completeness across all
methods is crucial for better code comprehension. Some methods lack JavaDoc entirely, which should
be rectified to provide comprehensive documentation for future developers. Also, there was no README
provided. I suggest providing one as it would be helpful for future developers to understanding the
code base.

Design/Code Limitations and Suggestions:
Code reusability is hindered by differences in coordinate systems, incomplete view implementation,
and the absence of strategy interfaces initially. To address this, we requested a Position2D
class and the necessary strategy interfaces and implementations. Eliminated redundant methods for
optional functionality.

In summary, the provided code exhibits potential but requires refinement in interface design,
implementation details, and documentation. The suggested changes aim to enhance code modularity,
user experience, and overall maintainability, fostering a more collaborative and adaptable codebase.
